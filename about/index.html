      <h2>Alright, so what's the deal?</h2>
      <p>Well, I originally started this somewhat as a joke. I was referencing a joke from Tuesdays with Tay to a friend, and couldn't remember the episode. So I created a tumblr blog listing the details of each episode. After a few episodes, I moved on and completely forgot about it. As I started to make my portfolio site, I realized I didn't have much in terms of Graphic Design to show. So I decided to come back and work to show my skills in Web Design.</p><br />
      <p>On top of that, as an artist something I really admire is the act of archiving niche areas. One of my favorite examples is a video essay about the history of the <a href="https://youtu.be/4e9Y3mO6an0">Sonic the Hedgehog Ice Cream Bar</a>. Because let's be honest, 95% of these questions aren't worth cataloguing.</p><br />
      <h3>The design is really similar to the official RFC site, why are you just copying it if you want to show your skills as a graphic designer?</h3><br />
      <p>You're right, and this is how it'll look for now. </p><br />
